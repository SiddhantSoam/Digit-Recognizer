# Digit-Recognizer
jupyer notebook for Digit Recognizer Kaggle Competition

Multiple techniques are used for digit recognizer dataset.
1) Deep Neural Networks without any custom function.
2) DNN with custom activation functions, custom initializer, custom regulaizer and constraint based models
3) CNN with different architectures
4) Ensemble technique is used by building 4 CNN models and then combining the results and use the ensembled result for prediction
5) Best accuracy achieved is 99.25%
6) Best Rank achieved is 419
